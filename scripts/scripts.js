They are continuously seeking dynamic experiences, speed, and competition, always striving to be first in everything from work to social gatherings. With its ruling planet Mars and belonging to the element of Fire (like Leo and Sagittarius), Aries is one of the most active zodiac signs. It is in their nature to take action, sometimes before thinking things through.\n\nThe Flying Ram is the symbol for Aries, guided by the story of the Golden Fleece. An Aries is ready to be the hero of the day, to fly away and carry many endangered and powerless people on their back. The power of the ram is carried on its back, for it is the gold itself, shiny and attractive to those ready for betrayal. The story of glory that isn't easy to carry is in the ram's two horns, and if this animal doesn't get shorn, allowing change and giving someone a warm shoulder, they won't have much to receive from the world. Each Aries has the task of willingly sharing their position, power, gold, or physical strength with others, or else the energy will be stopped in its natural flow, fear will take over, and the process of giving and receiving will hold balance at zero.",

Libra is a single point of balance amidst the sea of different extremes, symbolized only by the fifteenth degree of this magnificent sign, an object among animals and humans. There is something incredibly uncertain about Libra, as if they are unsure which side to choose next, recognizing that life's experiences teach us to be careful around others.
